# Analysis-of-21cm-waves
Analysis of 21cm waves from one of the arms of Milky Way galaxy.
The problem was a part of IOAA 2021 where we were to analyse and devise the solution within 3 hours. Once i get the questions would be posting those in this repo too.
The graphs interpret V_los(velocity in line of sight) vs Tb(effective temperature) within a certain longitude of observation.
If i can remeber correctly the question was to graph V_los vs Tb (which is done rarly) instead of Tb vs V_los (which is done most of the time)
Reviewed the code now download the graphs along with the loop.
I would be going through the codes again and make it more understandable. Cheers!
